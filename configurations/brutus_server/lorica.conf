#       -- CUSTOMIZED FOR BRUTUS SERVER INTEGRATION --
#
# This configuration file has been specially crafted to support
# integration with Brutus Server and Brutus Server clients. The 
# Interface Repository cache file "ifr.cache" must be manually 
# created unless it is contained in the distribution from 42tools.
#
# You can create the cache file by importing the Brutus IDL files 
# into the Interface Repository. IDL_ROOT is where the Brutus IDL
# files are stored. LORICA_ROOT is the installation directory of 
# Lorica. You will need Visual Studio C++ to do this.
#
# The import is accomplished in a Visual Studio command prompt with:
#
# cd %IDL_ROOT%
# %LORICA_ROOT%\tao_ifr -ORBInitRef InterfaceRepository=file://%LORICA_ROOT%\ifr.ior BrutusSession.idl
# %LORICA_ROOT%\tao_ifr -ORBInitRef InterfaceRepository=file://%LORICA_ROOT%\ifr.ior -Si IMailUser.idl
# %LORICA_ROOT%\tao_ifr -ORBInitRef InterfaceRepository=file://%LORICA_ROOT%\ifr.ior -Si IDistList.idl 
#
#                       *  ***  * 
#
# Syntax is: 
#          <> ==> Required, [] ==> Optional 
#
#    token/values:
#
#          "<TOKEN><WHITESPACE><VALUE(S)>[WHITESPACE]"
#
#    comment:
#
#          "#[ANY COMBINATION OF COMMENT TEXT AND WHITESPACE]"
#
# The tokens and values in this configuration file are case
# sensitive.
#
# Every option is clearly marked MANDATORY it is otherwise
# optional.
# 
# It is not allowed to start a line with a whitespace
# character unless that line is composed of whitespace 
# characters only. A whitespace character is defined as
# ' ', '\t' or '\r'.
# 
# The order of normal configuration tokens does not matter. Any
# trailing whitespace is ignored.
#
# The keyword token "IFR_CmdOption" and "ORB_Option" is 
# recognized by the parser to the effect that on WIndows you can 
# do things like:
#
# ORB_Option -ORBDebug
# ORB_Option -ORBLogFile
# ORB_Option C:\orb.log
#
# While on e.g. Linux you can do:
#
# ORB_Option -ORBDebug
# ORB_Option -ORBLogFile
# ORB_Option /home/some_user/tmp/orb.log
#
# The ORB in question will then be given the following 
# command-line options:
#
# "-ORBDebug -ORBLogFile C:\orb.log"
#
# The order is obviously important when specifying ORB options.
# The placement of the ORB options in the configuration file
# does not matter as long as their internal ordering are 
# kept. ORB options can thus be interplaced in between normal
# options if so desired.
#
# IFR_CmdOption is parsed to construct command line options for
# any collated IFR service.
#
# ORB_Option is parsed to construct command line options 
# for any ORB which is used by Lorica.
